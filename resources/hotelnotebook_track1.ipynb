If they did some updates in the rooms and made a few little changes, the prices they charge would be justified. Good things: decent location, quiet neighborhood, not too far from the city. Annoying things: the wifi is pretty bad during the day, the rooms are dated, the bed was pretty darn bad, their version of a continental breakfast consists of low-grade muffins and coffee, and they make you check out at 11am and don't allow late check-outs. I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first. This place advertises dishes and cutlery for your room (they have kitchens), but none was supplied. In my opinion, all those things arent too bad, but more so inconveniences. That's all I have.

There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch. This was very overpriced and there wasn't much service to justify this exorbitant fee.","key":92,"index":92},{"0":"Auburn","1":"42.199763","2":"-71.840633","3":"La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester","4":"3.0","5":"Positives: convenient to highway, close to restaurants, across from Auburn Mall, friendly staff, all public areas (lobby,dining area,hallways) clean, free wifi,good size room,roombathroom clean,hot water in shower,comfortable bed, free breakfast, good variety of breakfast foods, price is comparable to nearby hotels.

Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it.

When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in.

Etna to our right, to the sea at our feet, it was truly breathtaking. Day excursions to Siracuse, Mt. Etna and Castlemola plus a day just wandering around town made for an unforgettable vacation. The views from Etna and Castlemola were simply breathtaking - as was the drive up narrow, winding roads! Another pleasant surprise was the quality of Sicilian wines. The luxury apartments of the Villa Carlota were first class is all respects. Simona and Riccardo were absolutely first class in making us feel at home and helping us with recommendations on dining and sightseeing trips. Could not ask for two better hosts.

The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!

In short, if you need to stay in the area, this is a really good option.","key":199,"index":199}],"schema":[{"key":"0","name":"city","type":"string"},{"key":"1","name":"latitude","type":"string"},{"key":"2","name":"longitude","type":"string"},{"key":"3","name":"name","type":"string"},{"key":"4","name":"reviews_rating","type":"string"},{"key":"5","name":"reviews_text","type":"string"}],"truncated":false},"isSummary":false,"language":"scala","wranglerEntryContext":{"candidateVariableNames":["df1"],"dataframeType":"pyspark"}},"persist_state":{"view":{"type":"details","tableOptions":{},"chartOptions":{"chartType":"bar","categoryFieldKeys":["0"],"seriesFieldKeys":["0"],"aggregationType":"count","isStacked":false,"binsNumber":10,"wordFrequency":"-1"},"viewOptionsGroup":[{"tabItems":[{"type":"table","name":"Table","key":"0","options":{}},{"type":"chart","name":"Chart","key":"1","options":{"chartType":"bar","categoryFieldKeys":["0"],"seriesFieldKeys":["0"],"aggregationType":"count","isStacked":false,"binsNumber":10,"wordFrequency":"-1"}}]}]}}},"dce9a125-ea9a-4042-adcb-dfa856ea7426":{"type":"Synapse.DataFrame","sync_state":{"table":{"rows":[{"0":"Northbrook","1":"50.106529","2":"8.760921","3":"Sheraton Offenbach Hotel","4":"2.0","5":"I was disappointed with this hotel - it is definitely not up to the normal Sheraton standard.

The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!

Bottom line, the room was nice, the pool was ok - but I wouldn't come back to this hotel again.","6":"We traveled with two small kids and wanted something family friendly as this resort boasted to be when researching it. The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food,  it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone... they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out... we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!
